# Ultra-Secure-Password-Generator-by-Mike-Seaman

This project is an application that generates a random password that fulfills certain criteria selected by the user.  The user simply clicks the big red button and follows the instructions in the following prompts to generate their password!  First they are asked to choose a valid password lenth.  Then the user chooses at least one of the following character categories for their passord: lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters. This was a fun and challenging project, working entirely within a JavaScript file.
